This React Native code snippet demonstrates a common issue where the state update doesn't reflect immediately after a setState call within a loop or asynchronous operation.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }, 100);
}
```

The problem lies in the fact that `this.setState` is asynchronous. Each `setTimeout` callback attempts to update the state, but because the state updates aren't instantaneous, the previous state value may be used in subsequent updates, leading to an incorrect final count.

Another issue that might arise from asynchronous updates is that React Native won't re-render correctly after each update if they are too frequent. This can lead to unexpected results and incorrect UI.
