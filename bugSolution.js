The solution to this problem lies in understanding the asynchronous nature of `setState`.  Here's how we can fix the code using async/await:

```javascript
async function updateCount() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }
}

// Call the function
updateCount();
```

By using `async/await` and ensuring that each state update waits for the previous one to complete using `await`, we guarantee that the state update reflects the correct value in each iteration.  The use of a functional update `prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 })` within `setState` helps prevent potential race conditions and ensures that the component re-renders correctly.
